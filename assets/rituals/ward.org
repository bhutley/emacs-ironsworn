*** Ward

- [-] When you walk a wide circle, sprinkling the ground with salt, roll +wits. On a strong hit, choose two. On a weak hit, chose one:
    - When a foe first crosses the boundary, take +1 momentum.
    - When you first inflict harm against a foe within the boundary, inflict +1 harm.
    - Your ward is /likely/ ([[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/fate/ask-the-oracle.org][Ask the Oracle]]) to trap a foe within the boundary.

- [ ] As above, and improve the effect of your ward (+2 momentum, +2 harm, and 'almost certain').

- [ ] When you perform this ritual, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
