*** Augur

- [-] When you summon a flock of crows and ask a single question, roll +wits. On a strong hit, you interpret their calls as a helpful omen. Envision the response ([[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/fate/ask-the-oracle.org][Ask the Oracle]] if unsure) and take +2 momentum. On a weak hit, the crows ignore your question and offer a clue to an unrelated problem or opportunity in this area. Envision what you learn ([[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/fate/ask-the-oracle.org][Ask the Oracle]] if unsure), and take +1 momentum.

- [ ] As above, and the crows will also help guide you on the proper path. On a hit, add +1 on the next segment when you [[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/adventure/undertake-a-journey.org][Undertake a Journey]].

- [ ] When you perform this ritual, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
