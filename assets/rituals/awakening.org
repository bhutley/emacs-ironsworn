[[elisp:(rpgdm-ironsworn-store-default-character-state 'asset-simulacrum-hp 3)][Insert Simulacrum's Health]]

- [-] When you create a simulacrum, roll +heart. On a strong hit, your creation is given unnatural life. If it aids you as you make a move to assault or overcome an obstacle through strength, add +2. It has 3 health and suffers harm as appropriate, but is not a companion and may not be healed. At 0 health, it is dead. On a weak hit, as above, but if you roll a 1 on your action die when aided by your creation, you must [[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/adventure/face-danger.org][Face Danger]] +heart to keep it from turning on you (as a formidable foe).

- [ ] Your simulacrum has 6 health.

- [ ] When you perform this ritual, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
