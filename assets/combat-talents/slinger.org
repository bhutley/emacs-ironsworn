*** Slinger
If you wield a sling...

- [-] When launched from a sling, a simple stone inflicts deadly harm (2 harm). When you [[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/combat/enter-the-fray.org][Enter the Fray]] by barraging your foe with sling-bullets, inflict harm on a strong hit.

- [ ] When you [[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/combat/strike.org][Strike]] by launching stones at an advancing foe, you may choose one (before rolling).
    - Hold them back: Retain initiative on a weak hit, but inflict only 1 harm.
    - Hit them hard: Inflict +1 harm on a hit, but suffer -1 momentum.

- [ ] When you [[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/adventure/secure-advantage.org][Secure an Advantage]] by preparing stones of a special quality or material, add +1. Then, take +1 momentum or +1 supply on a hit.
