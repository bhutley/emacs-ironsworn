*** Pretender

- [-] When you establish a false identity, roll +shadow.
    - On a strong hit, you may add +2 when you make moves using this identity to deceive or influence others. If you roll a 1 on your action die when using your false identity, someone doubts you. Make appropriate moves to reassure them or prevent them from revealing the truth.
    - On a weak hit, as above, but add +1 (instead of +2).

- [ ] As above, and you may roll +shadow (instead of +heart) when you [[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/relationship/sojourn.org][Sojourn]] under your false identity. If you do, take +1 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] When you [[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/adventure/secure-advantage.org][Secure an Advantage]] by revealing your true identity in a dramatic moment, reroll any dice.
