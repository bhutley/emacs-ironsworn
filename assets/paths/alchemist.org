*** Alchemist

- [-] When you create an elixir, choose an effect:
    - deftness (edge)
    - audacity (heart)
    - vigor (iron)
    - slyness (shadow)
    - clarity (wits).
  Then, suffer -1 supply and roll +wits. On a strong hit, you create a single dose. The character who consumes the elixir must [[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/adventure/face-danger.org][Face Danger]] +iron and score a hit, after which they add +1 when making moves with the related stat until their health, spirit, or momentum fall below +1. On a weak hit, as above, but suffer an additional -1 supply to create it.

- [ ] As above, and you may choose two effects for a single dose, or create two doses of the same effect.

- [ ] When you prepare an elixir, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
