- [-] When you [[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/combat/turn-the-tide.org][Turn the Tide]], envision how your vows give you strength in this moment. Then, when you make your move, add +2 (instead of +1) and take +1 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] When you [[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/adventure/secure-advantage.org][Secure an Advantage]] or [[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/relationship/compel.org][Compel]] by telling a hard truth, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. On a weak hit or miss, envision how this truth complicates your current situation.

- [ ] When you [[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/quest/fulfill-your-vow.org][Fulfill Your Vow]] and score a miss, you may reroll one challenge die. If you score a miss again, reduce your maximum spirit by 1. You may recover this lost spirit when you next [[file:~/other/ironsworn/moves/quest/fulfill-your-vow.org][Fulfill Your Vow]] and score a strong hit.
